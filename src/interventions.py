"""The five ways of making the rare classes visible, one per run.

Each of these is one change to a run that is otherwise the sequence model exactly
as its parent trained it: same windows, same split, same architecture, same ten
epochs at batch 32, same seed. They divide into two kinds, and the difference
matters when reading a result.

Three of them change what the model learns. Weighting the classes in the loss and
replacing the loss with a focal one both change the size of the gradient a rare
window contributes. Oversampling changes how many times the model sees one.

Two of them change nothing about training and only change how a trained model's
output is turned into an answer. Logit adjustment subtracts the class priors from
the scores. Per-class thresholds divide each score by a number chosen for that
class. A run of either kind trains the same model its parent did and then decides
differently.

Nothing here reads the test partition. The priors and the class weights come from
the training rows, and the thresholds are chosen on validation.

    decides what the run is optimising before any update has happened.

    Three starts, because the same class serves the run and the check that the
    training loop is sound.

    `uniform` gives every group 1/n. This is the standard group-DRO start and it
    is what NB07b uses. Note what it means: a group of 24 windows and a group of
    8,290 carry the same weight from the first batch, so the run departs from its
    parent by group balancing before worst-group weighting has moved anything.

    `proportional` gives each group its share of the training windows. Under this
    weighting the weighted mean of group means is the mean over the windows in
    expectation, so it is the parent's objective written in this notation.

    `batch_share` takes the weights from the batch in front of it rather than
    carrying any state, which makes the objective exactly the mean loss over the
    batch. That is the parent's objective exactly rather than in expectation, and
    it is what the reproduction check runs: any difference from `model.fit` under
    it belongs to the loop and not to the weighting.

    The update is `q_g <- q_g * exp(eta * L_g)` over the groups present in the
    batch, followed by renormalising the whole vector. A group not in the batch
    keeps its unnormalised weight, so nothing about it is inferred from a batch it
    did not appear in; the renormalisation then rescales every group by the same
    constant, which leaves the absent groups' weights unchanged relative to each
    other and moves them relative to the groups that were updated. There is no way
    to renormalise that avoids that, and it is stated here rather than left for a
    reader to work out.

    `eta` of zero freezes `q` where it started, which is how the check runs.
