"""Writing a run to disk, and the metrics every run reports.

A run is a directory holding five files: the configuration it was produced under,
its metrics, the true labels, the predicted labels, and the fitted model. Always
the same five, so a result can be re-read later without the notebook that made it.

The `fit_and_save` functions exist so that fitting and saving are a single
statement. A cell that fits in one statement and saves in the next loses the fit
if the session drops in between, and a Colab session drops. Nothing here prints;
the notebook keeps the narrative and the printing.

`assert_single_change` is the other half of the discipline. Every run is a config
that inherits from a parent and overrides one key, and the check runs before the
fit rather than after it, so a run that would confound two changes never starts.
