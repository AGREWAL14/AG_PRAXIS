"""The sequence model: the reproduced record encoder, read across a window.

The convolutional network in `baselines/mohammadi/` takes one record at a time.
Its input is `(features, 1)`, its convolutions slide along the feature axis, and
it has no way of seeing what came before the record it is looking at. Everything
in this module is built around that network rather than in place of it.

`record_encoder` takes the published model as the baseline builds it and removes
only its final softmax layer, keeping the two convolutions, the two pooling
layers, the flatten and the dense 128 exactly as published. What is left turns
one record into 128 numbers. `build_model` applies that same encoder to each of
the fifty records in a window, runs one LSTM across the fifty results, and puts a
softmax over the classes on the end.

Nothing under `baselines/` is imported for anything but this, and nothing under
`baselines/` is changed. The published head is dropped rather than retrained,
because a classification head that read a single record is not the head this
model needs, and the encoder underneath it is the part the comparison is about.

    `assert_single_change` runs before anything is built, so a run that would
    confound two changes never starts. The seed is set immediately before the
    model is constructed, so no code can run between the two.

    `y_train` and `y_test` are integer positions into `classes`, and that is what
    `y_true.npy` and `y_pred.npy` hold: integer codes at `code_dtype`, with the
    list they index in `metrics.json`.

    `extra_metrics` is a function of the metrics document that returns more
    fields to put in it. It runs here rather than in the caller so that whatever
    it produces is written by the same statement that fitted the model.

    Three arguments exist for runs whose one change is an intervention, and all
    three are None for a run without one, leaving this function doing exactly what
    it did before they were added. `loss` replaces the loss at compile time.
    `class_weight` weights the classes in the fit. `decision_rule` is a function
    of the fitted model returning a rule for turning probabilities into codes and
    a record of how the rule was arrived at; the record goes into the metrics
    under `decision_rule`. A rule is built after the fit and before the test
    partition is touched, so a rule that needs a fitted model to choose its
    settings can have one without any of them being chosen on test.

    `groups`, `group_weights` and `group_names` are for a run whose one change is
    the training objective. With them the fit goes through `fit_group_dro` rather
    than `fit_model`, because an objective that depends on which capture a window
    came from cannot be expressed as a loss or as a class weighting. They are None
    for every other run, which leaves the fit exactly where it was.
