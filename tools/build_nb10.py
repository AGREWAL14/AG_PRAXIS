# Results consolidation

This notebook builds the tables and figures the results chapter is written from. It
computes nothing. Every number it writes has already been produced by an earlier run and
is sitting in this repository; the job here is to read those files, arrange them into
tables a reader can follow, draw three figures, and check every value against what the
project record and the results ledger already say.

That last part matters more than it sounds. Figures get quoted in prose, then the prose
gets edited, and the two drift apart. The check at the end reads each value this notebook
is about to hand to the chapter and compares it against the recorded figure. If any of
them disagree the notebook stops and says which one.

It needs no GPU and no accelerator of any kind. It reads JSON, CSV and small arrays, and
it runs on a laptop in under a minute. There is no model here, no training, no prediction,
and nothing that touches the network.

Filenames are descriptive. Numbering figures and tables happens when the chapter is
written, not here, because the numbering depends on the order things end up in the prose.

## Detection: single records against sequences

The first objective asks whether reading a run of records rather than one at a time
improves the classes a single-record model handles worst. Four models are being compared
and they are not scored on the same items, so the first table carries the unit each was
measured on alongside its score. A window of fifty records and a single record are not the

## Observation: how much traffic each class needs

The second objective asks how much has to be observed before a class stops improving, and
whether that differs between the two groups. Saturation is the smallest budget within a
fixed tolerance of a class's own best score across the grid, so it marks where a class
stops improving and not where it becomes reliably detectable. The grid takes four values,
which limits how finely any comparison between the two group medians can be read.

The third objective asks whether the features a model relies on can be resolved to a
documented attack pattern, and from there to a threat category, through a fixed mapping
written before any model was trained. Because the features that identify the recording
session are also the strongest timing features, the models explained here are trained
without them, and the first table records what that costs.

## The check

Every value above that the chapter will quote is compared here against the figure already
recorded in the project record and the results ledger. This is the point of the notebook
as much as the tables are: it is the last place a number that drifted can be caught before
it reaches the prose.

One divergence is expected and is reported rather than resolved. The threat mapping
artifact carries the pass mark that was in force when it ran, and the criterion was
restated afterwards. The result clears both, so nothing downstream moves, but the notebook
reports the older figure rather than quietly discarding it.
