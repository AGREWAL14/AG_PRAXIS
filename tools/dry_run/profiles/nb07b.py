"""What NB07b needs from a fixture, and what it should have written when it stops.

A profile is a description, not a script. It says which notebook to run, what the
fixture has to contain for that notebook's own asserts to hold, which asserts
cannot hold against a small fixture and are checked against the real metadata
instead, and what the run directory should look like afterwards.
