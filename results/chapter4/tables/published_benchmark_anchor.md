| Random forest, the published configuration, on a capture-disjoint split  | 0.868  | by recording session | macro                    |
| Random forest, the leaf setting chosen here, on a capture-disjoint split | 0.8418 | by recording session | macro                    |

Three things differ between the published figures and the runs here and none is controlled: the averaging method is not stated anywhere in the source, so the published figures may not be macro at all; the split is by capture file there and by recording session here; and the feature count is unsettled, with thirty-nine listed and forty-five shipped against the forty-four used here. This is a reference point showing where the work sits under a stricter protocol, not a controlled comparison between models.
